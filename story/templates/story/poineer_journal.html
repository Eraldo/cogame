        <h4>
            Dear diary,
        </h4>

        <p>
            … or isn’t that the way one is supposed to start a diary entry? – but wait, here in coLegend I already
            learned that it’s not about what “one” would do, but what I want to do…
            So let me start all over.
        </p>

        <h4>
            2013-12-14: First journal entry
        </h4>

        <p>
            So in any case – here I am – giving this journal thing a try. I must admit, I have had this idea of writing
            a diary once or twice already before joining coLegend but I was always too lazy to write something by hand –
            typing on the other hand is quite convenient… <br>
            So what has happened in the last days? Well… I joined coLegend – obviously.
            It was actually quite the coincidence how I found out about this group of people. I used to know this girl,
            Julia – I quite liked her when I first met her but then we did not really have the time to meet more often.
            However last week I ran into her again while shopping for Christmas presents. We talked about the soon
            approaching New Year’s Eve and she told me that she herself had spent quite some time reflecting on her last
            year and on the one to come as she’d joined a platform called coLegend where the members are quite keen on
            being conscious about what they’re doing. So when I got home I checked out their website and I really liked
            what I read. It gave me a good feeling and I knew Julia was part of it, too. So I decided to join </p>

        <p>
            After that I got in touch with the legends pretty fast – that’s the way the coLegend members are called. I
            got to know the core team, too. Some would say they’re a bunch of nerds – but I like their craziness, it’s a
            good kind of crazy :) with a lot of uplifting energy. They are deeply invested in the well-being of the
            legends and are convinced of this project. They believe themselves as part of this project just as everyone
            else - not as some kind of boss. They value each and everyone's story because that's what shapes the
            platform to be the place they envisioned it to be. <br>
            That got me thinking about what I want to get out of this platform?... Well… I guess I often wanted to
            change something in my life – or even to change my life in general. But I never had the guts to go through
            with it, or I got distracted by things that seemed more important, closer to life than chasing some distant
            vision, or dream. Now it seems as if I have a real chance committing to that energy of change. coLegend
            gives me the tools and the people – they’re both here to help me with it. So right now it seems like the
            hardest part is not fulfilling my wishes – but actually thinking about what I really want and allowing
            myself to put it in words which I have learned is an important step of creation … gosh, I start sounding
            like those legends already ;-). </p>

        <p>
            To be honest – I started freaking out a little when I thought about it… what do I truly want? What are my
            visions? It is something I never have given myself time to think about yet or even articulate. But when I
            met some other legends and talked to them I learned that they themselves often didn’t know right away what
            their next big project or vision would be either – but they told me this in itself is perfectly okay. I do
            not have to have things figured out yet. The simple desire and the willingness to follow the impulse is all
            it takes. <br>
            coLegend provides the tools for me – like this journal for example – and I will be taught exactly how to use
            them to find my next steps. On top of that I got people with whom I can talk about the process along the
            way. That will make it easier for me to share my feelings; well, first I could probably start with becoming
            aware of my feelings … my dreams, hopes and true desires. And the great thing is - I am not gonna be left
            alone with those new found treasures. I already found a thing called „manager“ – it’s supposed to be this
            tool that helps me think about what to do with my aspirations and how to get there step by step, making an
            occasional jump every now and then. And in case I don’t feel like talking to the other coLegend members – I
            can even use professional guidance counselling I heard! - I’m free to work on my path with those tools
            independently. I like that thought. </p>

        <p>
            What’s pretty cool, too, is that I don’t have to wreck my brain on what to do next or what questions to ask
            myself to advance on that self-development path. The platform guides me through that process by itself: All
            the steps that I’m able to do at the moment are laid out for me – so all I have to do is actually do them
            :).
        </p>

        <p>
            So I guess I’m at a point right now where I’ve run out of excuses why the heck I wouldn’t live the life I
            want to live! This is my life right here, right now and it’s about time I start being the lead role in my
            own story and take things into my own hands. I feel like I’ve finally found a group of people with who I
            want to share this adventure with… And besides – I’m also really looking forward to hearing their stories
            next to mine. If I remember it correctly, they call that “co-creating” a real legend J. Well – I guess, it’s
            going to be legen…wait for it…dary ;-)…
