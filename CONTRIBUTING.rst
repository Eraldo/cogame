How to Contribute
=================

Feel free to contact me (Eraldo) to get involved.

Always happy to get issues identified and pull requests!

Getting your pull request merged in
------------------------------------

#. Keep it small. The smaller the pull request the more likely I'll pull it in.
#. Pull requests that fix a current issue get priority for review.
#. If you're not already in the `CONTRIBUTORS.rst` file, add yourself!
