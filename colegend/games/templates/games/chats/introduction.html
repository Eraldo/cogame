        This is the <strong>tutorial</strong> deck page - the place where you are guided through basic parts of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        The coCards below present you with tasks that will show you the way.
        One deck contains all the cards meant for one game round.
        Clicking on a card next to the deck lets you see its task - you can then head off to accomplish it. When you
        have done all the cards lying next to the deck you’ll get dealt a new hand of cards until the deck is empty.
    </p>
    <p>
        So enjoy… and let's begin ;-)
