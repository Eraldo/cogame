                Where am I?</h1>

            <p>
                It is a Socially-Intelligent Life-Management Platform.<br/>
                But that are just words..<br/>
                So, why does it exist?<br/>
            <ol>
                <li>To help you find out what you truly and deeply want.</li>
                <li>To support you on that path and help you get there.</li>
                (and make the journey an awesome one)
            </ol>
            According to an old legend, some people are chosen to live an awesome life.
            They break out of the typical
            life and transform into ..well.. legends.
            The interesting question here is:
            Are you one of them?
            - Well, let us find out.
