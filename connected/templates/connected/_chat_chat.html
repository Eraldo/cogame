    <p>
        It’s time to get you into contact with other fellow legends. For this we have Slack. It’s a chat with topic
        specific channels - for example to ask questions about coLegend in the Support Channel - and private
        conversation options.

        So on the next page just follow the steps and you’re ready to go ;-)
